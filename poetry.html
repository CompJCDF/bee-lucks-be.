<h3>
PLAINE JAINE:
</h3>
<p>
Aircraft, carry her</p>
<p>Thoughts far away.</p>
<p>
Suspended in visions of ski tracks on clouds
</p>
<p>“Un-hole-y” expanse over unholy grounds.
</p>
<p>Unwholesome, Underproductive, Unwieldy
</p>
<p>gyal.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She tucked it away:
</p>
<p>Out of sight.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Never tell.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Restricted to Nuerons,
</p>
<p>to impulse, to signals
</p>
<p>Of light.
</p>
<p>to cranial physical
</p>
<p>optical optimization of visual cues.
</p>

<p>The Light from the Bright of the White of the Clouds..
</p>
<p>is giving her spectrums
</p>
<p>of all of the hues.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“i don’t believe in the ground below,”
</p>
<p>she whispered to the sky.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Sky, She answered Slow and Fast;
</p>
<p>so Bold that She was Shy:
</p>

“So above shall be below,
for there’s a centre to it all you know.

<p>I am Blue</p>
<p> and so are You</p>

you’ll know the Ground when I say so."

<h5>
DISSERTATION PHASE:
</h5>
<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
World.
</p>

<p>
“  Let us       reinvent      …
</p>
<p>
… the English.</p>
<p>
Language.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
We will call it Snake, instead.
<p/>
<p>The Apple bit the Girl, After All.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
“Okay, yes. Sure.”
</p>
<p>
She said.
<p>
  She was sure.
</p>
<p>
Yet she was sad.
</p>
<p>
“But I am a Californian.”
</p>
<p>
“Why does that matter?”
</p>
<p>
“I am a Californian. I speak American. But I hate America.”
<p>
  She was referring to the ‘AmeriKKKa’ in the Childish Gambino song, not the California that nurtured her privileged youth and kissed her youthful cheeks with sun and snow and sea spray each summer.
</p>
<p>
Winter came, days shortened. The island grew colder and meaner each month. No one told her she was not okay. She knew though. She had been there before. There was the sadness that once again draped a
Black Mourning Cloth
</p>
<p>
upon her strong shoulders. Reality stopped short of real so she smiled through her tears and she started to admit to herself,
</p>
<p>once more
</p>
<p>that it might be
</p>
<p>for
</p>
<p>forever.
</p>
<p>
A grin.
</p>
<p>
Shagrin.
</p>
<p>
A grim first day.
</p>
<p>
The baby gecko,
<p>
whom she had dubbed Tomás,
</p>
<p>flew the coop and left the nest and
</p>
<p>
was not her Soul Mate (and all that).
</p>
<p>
That’s okay.
</p>
<p>
I’m okay.
</p>
<p>
I’ve found another (Soul Mate)
</p>
<p>
Anyway.
</p>
<p>
So now
</p>
<p>Until Seventh September
</p>
<p>I ask Only one thing
</p>
<p>And Only for Forever:
</p>
<p>Baby, I’m lost. Baby, I’m scared.
</p>
<p>I need my money and the cards are broke and the banks won’t call back but the gold is the vault.
</p>
<p>My city is burning.
</p>
<p>
  Santa Cruz. Cue the muse. Music doesn’t cut it anymore. Can’t you see? Won’t you see? Why does not my plea
</p>
<p>
  leave my lips when the sinking ships
</p>
<p>
  from the East Moors of Britain couldn’t even reach the San Francisco Bay? Back to the day.
</p>
<p>
His Story won’t repeat itself if God is a Woman.
</p>
  <p>
  Baby, what can I do with my impromptu
</p>
<p>
School Day?
</p>

[V] 5.ODO AL OSO DURMIENTE MIO:

<p>
a restaurant sat in Oakland on the East side near the old house on Monadnock Way. It was an old place, resting gently in the black lives matter present reaching back towards the mlk and Malcolm x’s of the past. We were away from the time/space continuum and no one could touch us.
</p>
<p>
I love the smell of roasting coffee in the morning after I finally get a good rest. Can you feel the love of the morning moon rising on your face? That’s the egg I feed you from the hen of the afternoon. Her rooster crows but she can’t hear him. For it is all only temporary, this too shall pass, and no one is no one. Please remember to reach out to your family, your music, your neverending circle of life. You are always fine and you are always here. This is not a place for the faint of heart or the weak of mind. Our restaurant does not tolerate hatred in any of its many forms. Please enter, but at risk of being chucked out with the bins if you carry sexism, xenophobia or fear within your soul. We are friendly, for we are sleeping. Our bark is worse than our bite.
